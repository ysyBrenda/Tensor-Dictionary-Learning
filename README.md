by Shuyan Yu,Hao Deng*,Zhankun Liu,Jin Chen,Xiaotang Gu, Jiaxin Li,Keyan Xiao,Xiancheng Mao 

## Program language 
- MATLAB 

## Dependencies required
- MATLAB 2017b or higher

## Usage
Run `TensorDictionaryLearning.m` to laod geochemical data and identify multivariate geochemical anomalies via tensor dictioanry learning method.

In the "Octave" folder, there are versions of the code that can be run in the Octave software.
